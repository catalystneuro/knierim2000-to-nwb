"""Session and subject metadata for the McNaughton Neurolab dataset.

The Neurolab STS-90 mission flew April 17 – May 3, 1998. Three rats with
hippocampal tetrode implants were recorded preflight (ground) and in-flight
on Flight Day 4 (April 20) and Flight Day 9 (April 25).

Rat 1 and Rat 2 were recorded simultaneously on the same acquisition system
(different tetrode banks). Rat 3 was recorded in a separate session.
